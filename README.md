djangae-ricdisks
================

my first DjangoNonRel + GoogleAppEngine project. I will try to feed my ricdisk code into this to navigate and search for files :) Maybe I can also try some MapReduce!

TODO
----

- upload ricdisks
- get a gauge with disk occupation in percentage.
- search engine to look for mp3.
- implement a cache of interesting files (AVIs of size > 200MB, mp3s, ..)
- populate/search METADATA
- create concept of computer with its disks... and implement disk nomadicity.

Credits

Just me (for the moment)
